# huffman_analysis
Two scripts to prints the average lenght, the entropy and the efficiency of the coded message

The first script, "codeHuffmanMessage", gets a message and prints the informations above.
The second one, "codeHuffmanProbability", gets the probability of the symbols and prints the information above.

Both scripts asks the coded symbol, because I don't know to code the huffman's tree yet (sorry).

Also, the input is via hard code, I don't asks via input because I just wrote it to do a college work.

Feel free to criticizes the scripts. :)

Lastly, sorry for my bad english.
